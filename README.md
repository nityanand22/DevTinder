# Hello

- I have started my journey of Backend where i am learning about node js and express js

- Multiple Route Handlers - Play with the code
- next()
- next function and errors along with res.send()
- app.use("/route", rH, [rH2, rH3], rH4, rh5)
- What is middleware ? Why do we need it?
- How express JS basically handles requests behind the scenes
- Difference app.use and app.all .
- Write a dummy auth middleware for admin
- Write a dummy auth middleware for all user routes, except /user/login
- Error Handling using app.use("/", (err, req, res, next)=>{})

- Create a free cluster on MongoDB official website (Mongo Atlas)
- Install mongoose library
- Connect your application to the Database "Connection-url"/devTinder
- Call the connectDB function and connect to database before starting application on 3000
- Create a UserSchema and user model
